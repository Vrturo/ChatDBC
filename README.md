# Chat.DBC
Chat.DBC is a simple real time messenger web app that uses React on the front end and Ruby on Rails on the back. Multiple users can be logged in and it will auto update their messages without reloading the page.

## Technical Stack

#### Front End
For the front end I used React. I wanted this app to be real time, and the main purpose of this was to get a better feel for React. The components directory holds all the different front end items, and with React it lets you add logic to the Front End like when there's a change in the state of an object.


#### Back End
I used Rails on the Back End of this app. I chose Rails because I felt as if Rails' asset pipeline would be a really easy way to manage all of React's components. This is a pretty simple app and the only API I used was the firebase API to let users log in through their Github.
