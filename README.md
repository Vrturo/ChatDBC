# Chat.DBC
Chat.DBC is a simple real time messenger web app that uses React on the front end and Ruby on Rails on the back. Multiple users can be logged in and it will auto update their messages without reloading the page.

If any ideas or would like to contribute just email arturop44@yahoo.com

For testing:
Git clone the repo
Bundle install

rails s

and run on localhost:3000
