Creating a simple messenger web app while learning React and Ruby on Rails.

Why React?
React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces by Facebook and Instagram. Many people choose to think of React as the V in MVC.

Simple
Simply express how your app should look at any given point in time, and React will automatically manage all UI updates when your underlying data changes.

Declarative
When the data changes, React conceptually hits the "refresh" button, and knows to only update the changed parts.

Build Composable Components
React is all about building reusable components. In fact, with React the only thing you do is build components. Since they're so encapsulated, components make code reuse, testing, and separation of concerns easy.
